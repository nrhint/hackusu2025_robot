# hackusu2025 robot

# Goal:

Our goal is to build a robot that is able to map out the room. The minimum is to use ultrasonic sensors to measure distances in the room. Our goal is to add on parts such as a GPS module and/or a gyroscope to make our measurements more precise.

The data will be gathered by a combination RPI and Arduino UNO. Our robot will use steppers to drive around and the base will be 3d printed. We will use a battery to power the PI which will have the Arduino and possibly GPS plugged into it. There will also be a 5V rail that will be connected to the boards to power the steppers and sensors seperate from the PI.
